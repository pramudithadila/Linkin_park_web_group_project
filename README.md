This is Group coursework which I did with my four university friends related to the Web Designing Module.
We have to make a fully functional website from the following domains: Health, Sport, Music, Education and Entertainment.
After discussing it with group members, we selected Music as our domain and decided to make a website for the famous Linkin Park Music Band.
Technologies used in the Above Coursework are Only HTML, CSS and JavaScript
